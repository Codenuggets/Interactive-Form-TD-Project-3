# Interactive Form TD Project 3
 JavaScript project that makes a website form more user friendly by adding customized, conditional behavior, validating user input and providing helpful error message

 Since there are no dedicated functions, instead this readme will be broken down by section of the form and listing the variables used

## Global variables
* `emailRegex` - Used to store the email checking Regex to be used for real time form Validation
* `noError` - Boolean value to help check for potential errors later in the submission process
